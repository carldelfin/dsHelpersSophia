\item{include}{A character or vector of characters containing only the nodes you want to connect to. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{exclude}{A character or vector of characters containing only the nodes you do not want to connect to. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{append_name}{A character, appending the node name, useful when using multiple concurrent sessions. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{restore}{A character, the name of a saved workspace on the node. See \code{DSI::datashield.workspaces} and related functions. Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\description{
Allows the user to connect to SOPHIA federated database nodes, with the option of including and excluding specific nodes (a node in this context is a server that hosts a database). Note that connecting to the federated database is a two-step process: First, the user connects to each individual node in order to retrieve a list of all cohorts that are hosted on that specific node (cohorts in this context refer to a specific dataset associated with a study or research project). Then, the user is disconnected and reconnected to each individual cohort.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# connect to all nodes, assuming username and password is specified in .Renviron:
dshSophiaConnect()

# connect to all nodes, manually providing username and password:
dshSophiaConnect(username = "username", password = "password")

# include specific nodes:
dshSophiaConnect(include = c("node1", "node2"))

# exclude specific nodes:
dshSophiaConnect(exclude = c("node3", "node4"))
}
